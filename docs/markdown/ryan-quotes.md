## Ryan "You don't just say quotes" Xu: 

### "If you aren't comfortable with what you say being recorded in history, then why say it at all?"

> [Sleeping] Ryan: "Nooooo... Fuck that's wrong"
>
> *a few seconds later*
>
>"It's not complicated"

>Me: "It's not like I'd walk up to someone and be like, 'Did you catch the last Commies game?'"
>
>Ryan: "You would totally do that."
>
>Me: "Oh, yeah, I guess I would. In fact I'm definitely going to do that for the Eagles game."

>Me: "You really couldn't wait an extra 10 seconds. Don't you know patience is a virtue."
>
>Ryan: "Yeah well it's not like we always have to display your virtues."
>
>Me: "Well the phrase is not 'patience is sometimes a virtue.'"
>
>Ryan: ...
>
>Me: "It's ok, I've never thought of you as particularly virtuous." 

>Me: "Did you enjoy lecture today, Ryan?"
>
>Ryan: "Yeah well I would have enjoyed 75 minutes of doing nothing, but I think in theory it's a good idea to go to lecture."


>"You don't just say quotes"

>Ryan: "This happens more than you think."
>
>Me: "You mean dreams about shirts?"
>
>Ryan: "No like I'll remember something and it'll be from a dream"
>
>*A few seconds later...*
>
>Ryan: "I kinda do want that shirt..."
>
>"Dang, I'm kinda sad now, I really wanted to save so much money. It was like save $10 and a two-for-one deal."
>
>*Later later...*
>
>Ryan grumbling
>
>Me: "Please tell me you aren't still thinking about t-shirts"
>
>Ryan: "No, I'm just wondering why I ordered a small t-shirt"
>
>Me: "You're still talking about t-shirts!!"
>
>Ryan: "Sizing is just so annoying."

>"Nah, man you don't just amputate someone's shoulder. That's like a euphemism for killing someone. 'I amputated their shoulder'"

>"You got to go backwards to go forwards"

>"Groundhogs day has the power to extend winter by 6 weeks! We literally define winter!"

>Me: "What are tactics?"
>
>Ryan: "It's knowing when you make a move whether it will instantly lose you the game or not."

>Me: "I'm going to be late to ML as per usual."
>
>Ryan:"I won't be late."
>
>Me: "Well, what do they say? Better late than"... *points*
>
>Ryan: "Don't worry, I'll go next semester."

>Ryan:"My past-self, pretty wise guy"

>[Ryan is in favor of raising the TA wage scale]
>
>Ryan: "You clock infinite hours up to 20"
>
>Ryan: "They make the rate low to adjust for people who do that. That's how you gotta do it I'm telling you, Huy. "
>
>Me: "Are you clocking 20 hours every week, Ryan?"
>
>Ryan: "I would never." 

>"What? I would never commit fraud. It's called JUSTICE. Equitable compensation." 

>Huy: "Did you have alcohol?"	
>
>Ryan: "Yeah I had wine and it tasted just like that stuff you have before the dentist"
>
>"It tasted just like that stuff, and you don't swallow that stuff"

>[on the third day of OS lecture]
>
>Me: "Are you skipping OS today?"
>
>Ryan: "YES! If it wasn't obvious I'm skipping OS lecture today ughqhuwhfwe"
>
>(I think I woke the dead, oops)

>Ryan: "Yeah, we get to avoid paper cuts"
>
>Me: "Paper cuts? Don't you mean splinters?"
>
>Ryan: "Paper cuts like hand injury, like nicks. Actually I guess splinters are pretty dangerous... The worst a paper can get is like it hurts."

>"Where are our teleportation majors?!"

>Me: There's a line between bravery and stupidity.
>
>Ryan: No they are always synonmyous. If you need to be brave, then it's dumb. Like if you know that something is the right thing to do, like you're being smart about it (aka not dumb) [he actually said this] then you are just being correct. Therefore bravery and stupidity are synonmyous. 

>The word brave is a big domain *(draws circle)*. I'm just refining the definition. 

>Everything's nuanced. You cannot encapsulate an entire conversation in a single quote. 
>
>*Later...*
>
>Like you can describe something as bravery, it can be positive, it can be smart, but perhaps I wouldn't use that word. But to ME, I wouldn't use that word.

>You have to capture it in the moment. The facts that are coming from this head don't wait, they don't pause. You need to increase your WPM to capture all of the thoughts. 

>"I don't have to word."

>Me: Ryan, I think you were talking in your sleep last night but I don't remember what you said"
>
>Ryan: "Oh yeah!!! [He's excited]. Yesterday I had this great dream that woke me up at 6am. I had a dream and it was really vivid. But then I was like.... it's too early so I went back to sleep"

>[on Space Jam 2]
>
>Me: So was the movie good, Ryan?
>
>Ryan: Yeah, it was good. It was entertaining. Wait what happened in that movie?...Yeah watching the game was interesting. There's like the Dream team and like the Looney Tunes?

>[on 0% rotten tomato movies]
>
>Ryan: How come they all look so bad?

>Me: Do you like the pizza, Ryan?
>
>Ryan: It's free.

>Me: I'm still full from all the chili I ate today.
>
>Ryan: What is chili? 
>
>[Jenny and I look at him]
>
>Me: It's a type of food.
>
>Ryan: That doesn't answer my question.
>
>Me: Are you purposefully being dumb? 
>
>Ryan: No like literally what is it? Like if I go to Chili's is it all chili?
>
>Me [pointing at Ryan]: Dude I told you this guy.

>Just because I said I didn't know what chili is doesn't mean I didn't know what it is at all. I'm just aware of my own lack of knowledge and I was trying to increase my knowledge. 
>
>Mainly I know what it's not.
>
>For all I know they are a chili special restaurant all they sell is chili. I've never even remembered the ad. I don't know if I walk in I don't know if I'm going to be forced into eating chili. 

>"I made the chili jump."

>[on grinding for BBO]
>
>I need to download RAM

>Ryan: Years. Well it's funny cause you could say .5 years. Like if someone rolls up and says they've been doing something for .1 years then you'd be pretty disappointed.
>
>Me: Do you want me to do that? Cause I gotchu. I've been studying OS for years. 

>[banana in hand]
>
>If you have a one step process and step 1 is suffer and you're over that, then. [gestures with banana]

>[on my worth]
>
>You're worth a dollar

>"That's just controlled superstitution."

>Me: They're very clearly friends.
>
>Ryan: Yeah. I mean... I don't know. 

>Me: What does this have to do about the onion?
>
>Ryan: Ignore the onion, it's not all about the onion.

>Me: Why is it an n-d sphere?
>
>Ryan: Because it's the world.
>
>Me: Isn't the world in 3 dimensions?

>Me: [Raises hand]. Is the onion in n dimensions?
>
>Ryan: Ignore the onion, we're moving to a new model.

>Me: What does this have to do with the sphere?
>
>Ryan: Oh, well, the sphere is just there to appeal to the old model, the onion... We're in the early stages, despite how this may appear this is not the most polished theory. I know I'm presenting it as if it's been well-founded, and you know, like there's a great consensus in the community.
>
>Me: What community?
>
>Ryan: Don't worry about it. It's in the works to some extent. It's a pretty good model. 

>Ryan: Like you have a maximum likelihood estimator, which takes as input all the things you know for sure, which is all the input your senses have. There's the important MLE. The issue with the brain is that you have MLE for things you're just speculating. The trick is to not confuse that MLE with the baseline MLE that you know for sure. There are knowns and there are unknowns, and your MLE brain will attempt to cover both, like what you know you know with very high probability, sometimes you get it wrong, but yknow. Like maybe the other MLE is high acccuracy, but you don't just make those assumptions. You stick to where you're located in the n-dimensional space. Don't wander with your hypotheses of possibly true stuff. 

>Human situations, there's a lot happening, it can't be captured by just two or three coordinates. Like of course it's in n dimensions, everything is in n-dimensions. 

>See it ties into the process, you said "do stuff" it's very intuitive. It ties into the process. 

>Me: So what you're saying is I should tell her I hate her and that I'm never going to see her again. 
>
>Ryan: Uhhhh, well I don't know about the model. I don't think I want to explain this again. 

>Ryan: Isaac Newton has the theory of gravity and like I can't think of anymore theories.

>Ryan: *woosh*

>[whistling the Rocky theme out of tune]
>
>Jenny: Stop!
>
>Ryan: Why do you want me to stop? You want to troll ME!

>Wait so we're watching the second one because it's the one that is 0%, but do you think we'll have contingency [sic] problems? 

>"I'm just participating in the movie."

>[singing]

>Sitting in a tree k-i-s-s-i-n-g

>Jenny: I need to have higher standards in finding a boyfriend.

>Jenny: Why the frick are you taking off your fucking glasses? If I have to watch this movie so do you. 

>I gave you the gift of laughter. It's a gift that keeps on giving.

>Me; Is that your new favorite party trick? Roll up and be like "I can do a one-line swap"
>
>Ryan: It's more than just one swap, it's multi swap. It's just so powerful.

>"I don't really know what I'm arguing here"

>[Lyrics to Havana]
>
>He got me feelin' like...
>
>Ryan to Jenny:
>
>*Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (ayy)*

>No my utility of action 1 of player 1!

>[On Okenshields facilitating conversation]
>
>If the food was too good, you'd be too focused on the food: like this pasta is so good, but if the food was so bad, then that would be all you were talking about. 

>Ryan: Think about it, next year you're going to get paid 50 dollars an hour. Think about it: is the work you are doing now any different than the work you'll do next year?
>
>Me: Well, there's a possibility I don't get hired next year.
>
>Ryan: That's why you got to get it in now.

>[Ryan on one mimosa with extra orange juice]

>If someone saying quotes while sober is this wise, then who knows what they are going to say when they are drunk?

>"Oken is such a rarefied cuisine."

> [me to a captive audience]: Actually, I know Ryan's middle school flex: He was a chess champion in middle school and elementary school.
>
> Ryan: Actually I was a chess champion in high school, too. But champion is loosely defined. 

> [on Jenny meeting Ryan's parents]
> 
> Me: Did they learn about you, Jenny?
> 
> Jenny: No, I gave no opinions.
>
> Ryan: There will be time for that later.
> [collective freakout]
>
> Jenny: I'm going to be sick tomorrow.

> When I got here there were 6 pens in that cup!

> [tips hat]
> Ryan to Jenny: Dear madam or dear lady

> Ryan: That's questionable.
>
> Tia: What do you mean?
> 
> Ryan: Because I question it

> [on 1 star reviews]
> At a one star restaurant, not everyone gives 1 star reviews. I'm one of those people who thinks it's OK.


> Ryan: It's good to look young so you can qualify for the youth discounts.
>
> Me: I'm a little too tall to get away with this discount, but maybe Ryan can uh—

> The road is intoxicating.

## The Cups

> I've been using the same fork for 12 weeks. It's causing me to reexamine my beliefs about the cup.

> I'm not a conspiracy theorist, but I'm going to argue that the old cup was more... voluptuous. 

> Ryan: Ok, so repeat the theory.
>
> Jenny: Ok, so they *did* make the cup smaller—
>
> Ryan: Sounds good!

> The chef there is measuring time by drinking from a cup. So now the cup is smaller so it gets cooked for less time. Perfect!

> No it's a good theory. To the lay person it would sound outlandish.

> What about selective discrimination?
>
> Isn't that just discrimination?

> Are you looking at Quora? Quotation??? Yeah I don't know who to trust when it comes to Shaq's degrees

> Nut bending is not canon.

> A pineapple is a long range fruit

> There's so much power in infinite fruit.

> Jenny: I think I'm better at telling jokes than you
>
> Ryan: No, I'm just better at laughing

> You know buttkicks? Like in P.E? 
>
> But... when you do butkicks are you running? Is there a time when you don't have your feet on the ground. 
> 
> On the same topic, you know how there's race walking—well everyone's cheating. Yeah if you get called out 3 times you get kicked out. It's an Olympic sport. 
> 
> Back to the original point: if you wanted to drop kick yourself, you just need to do some buttkicks. 

> Me: Can you repeat that again but more confidently this time?
> 
> Ryan: OK [pounds fists on table]. Wait actually I forgot the name of the law.

> [Dancing] Just hanging out. Hanging out with my family. Having ourselves a paaaarty.

> Ryan: How about airplane food?
>
> Me: What about airplane food?
>
> Ryan: That's it. You just say how about that airplane food and it's a joke.

> Ryan: I'm a word guy and a sequence of words guy. I like idioms.
>
> Me: Oh, so you like Chinese. 
>
> Ryan: Well, I'm not a Chinese word guy. I'm like a guy who's Chinese not a Chinese guy. 

> Me: Well, you're such an idiom guy. How about 'when you're deep in shit shut your mouth.'
>
> Ryan: Well I'll say better to have tried then...

> It's easier to move around if you can move your legs. Presumably. 

> Me: We get it, you're rich.
>
> Ryan: No, at that time I was only in the 4000 square foot house.

> Me: Did you know Madagascar is one of the poorest nations in the world.
>
> Ryan: Oh

> Ryan: Why?

> Ryan: Well, I was expecting a punchline.
