## Quotes from Selected Works

> Since the beginning of storytelling, he explained, Death has called on the unwitting. In one tale or another, it arrives quietly in town and takes a room in an inn, or lurks in an alleyway, or lingers in the marketplace, surreptitously. Then just when the hero has a moment of respite from his daily affairs, Death pays him a visit. 
> 
> This is all well and good, allowed the Count. But what is rarely related is the fact that Life is every bit as devious as Death. It too can wear a hooded coat. It too can slip into town, lurk in an alley, or wait in the back of a tavern. (225) — Alexander Ilyich Rostov on Life and Death

> The choices don't stop, however. Life is choices, and they are relentless. No sooner have you made one choice than another is upon you. (215)

> I love short stories because I believe they are the way we live. They are what our friends tell us, in their pain and joy, their passion and rage, their yearning and their cry against injustice. We can sit all night with our friend while he talks about the end of his marriage, and what we finally get is a collection of stories about passion, tenderness, misunderstanding, sorrow, money; those hours and days and moments when he was absolutely married, whether he and his wife were screaming at each other, or sulking around the house, or making love. While his marriage was dying, he was also working; spending evenings with friends, rearing children, but those are other stories. Which is why, days after hearing a painful story by a friend, we see him and say: How are you? We know that by now he may have another story to tell, or he may be in the middle of one, and we hope it is joyful.

> We don't talk about it. There's never so much as a knowing look. We sit here in silence, eating our lunch. But I know we are all here for the same reason. We're all searching for a piece of home, or a piece of ourselves. We look for a taste of it in the food we order and the ingredients we buy. Then we separate. We bring the haul back to our dorm rooms or our suburban kithcens, and we re-create the dish that couldn't be made without our journey. What we're looking for isn't available at a Trader Joe's. H Mart is where your people gather under one odorous roof, full of faith that they'll find something they can't find anywhere else.

> In the H Mart food court, I find myself again, searching for the first chapter of the story I want to tell about my mother. I am sitting next to a Korean mother and her son, who have unknowingly taken the table next to ol' waterworks. The kid dutifully gets their silverware from the counter and places in on paper napkins for both of them. He's eating fried rice and his mom has seoloeongtang, ox-bone soup. He must be in his early twenties, but his mother is still unstructing him on how to eat, just like my mom used to. "Dip the onion in the paste." "Don't add too much gochujang or it'll be to salty." "Why aren't you eating the mung beans?" Some days, the constant naggging would annoy me. Woman, let me eat in peace! But, most days, I knew it was the ultimate display of a Korean woman's tenderness, and I cherished that love. A love I'd do anything to have back. (10)

> Zoe to Linus:
>
> "Let me tll you something, Linus Baker," she said, hands clencehd on the top of the driver's door. "There are moments in your life, moments when chances have to be taken. It's scary because there is always the possibility of failure. I know that. I *know* that. Because once upon a time, I took a chance on a man that I had failed before. I was *scared *. I was *terrified*. I thought I might lose everything. But I wasn't living, then. The life I had before wasn't *living*. It was getting by. And I will never regret the chances I took. Because it brought me to them. To all of them. I made my choice. And you're making yours." She opened the door and got in the car. The engine turned over. She looked back at him just once when she said, "Don't you wish things could be different?" (339).

> To know one's state is not a simple matter. One cannot look directly at one's own face with one's own eyes, for example. One has no choice but to look at one's reflection in the mirror. 
Through experience, we come to believe that the image is correct, but that is all (282). — Malta Kano

> Because I am your son, what I know of work I know equally of loss. And what I know of both I know of your hands. Their once supple contours I've never felt, the palms already callused and blistered long before I was born, then ruined further from three decades in factories and nail salons. Your hands are hideous — and I hate everything that made them that way. I hate how they are the wreck and reckoning of a dream. How you'd come home, night after night, plop down on the couch, and fall asleep inside a minute. I'd come back with your glass of water and you'd already be snoring, your hands in your lap like two partially scaled fish.

> What I know is that the nail salon is more than a place of work and workshop for beauty, it is also a place where our children are raised—a number of whom, like cousin Victor, will get asthma from years of breathing the noxious fumes into their still-developing lungs. The salon is also a kitchen where, in the back rooms, our women squat on the floor over huge woks that pop and sizzle over electric burners, cauldrons of pho simmer and steam up the cramped spaces with aromas of cloves, cinnamon, ginger, mint, and cardmom mixing with formaldehyde, toulene, acetone, Pine-Sol, and bleach. A place where folklore, rumors, tall tales, and jokes from the old country are told, expanded, laughter erupting in back rooms the size of rich people's closets, then quickly lulled into an eerie, untouched quiet. It's a makeshift classroom where we arrive, fresh off the boat, the plane, the depths, hoping the salon would be a temporary stop—until we get on our feet, or rather, until our jaws soften around English syllables—bend over workbooks at manicure desks, finishing homework for nighttime ESL classes that cost a quarter of our wages.

> I won't stay here long, we might say. I'll get a real job soon. But more often than not, sometimes within months, even weeks, we will walk back into the shop, head lowered, our manicure drills inside paper bags tucked under our arms, and ask for our jobs back. And often the owner, out of pity or understanding or both, will simply nod at an empty desk—for there is always an empty desk. Because no one stays long enough and someone is always just-gone. Because there are no salaries, health care, or contracts, the body being the only material to work with and work from. Having nothing, it becomes its own contract, a testimony of presence. We will do this for decades—until our lungs can no longer breathe without swelling, our livers hardening with chemicals—our joints brittle and inflamed from arthritis—stringing together a kind of life. A new immigrant, within two yeas, will come to know that the salon is, in the end, a place where dreams become the calcified knowledge of what it means to be awake in American bones—with or without citizenship—aching, toxic, and underpaid.

> Myrna tells a story about her father and his performances:
>
> Before your father began teaching, back in the days when he performed, you had seen a rod puppet of his go down on its knees before a girl who sat a little aside from his audience of schoolchildren. This girl had been looking on with her hair hanging over her face, only partly hiding a cruel-looking scar; her eyes shone with hatred. Not necessarily hatred of your father or of puppets or the other children but a hatred for make-believe, which did not heal, but was only useful to the people who didn't need it. Man and long-bearded puppet left the stage, walked over to the girl, and knelt—the puppet's kneeling was of course guided by your father's hand, and every eye in the audience was on your father's face, but his uncertain expression convinced everyone that the puppet had suddenly expressed a will of its own. "Princess, I am Merlin, your Merlin," the puppet man said to the girl. "At your service forever." 
>
> "Me?" the girl said, suspicious, on the edge of wrath—*you just try and make me the butt of your joke*—"Me, a princess? You, at my service?"
>
>"It's no mistake." The puppet's hand moved slowly, reverently; it held its breath despite having no breath to hold, the girl allowed that wooden hand to fondly brush her cheek—watching, you were absolutely sure that no hand of flesh and bone would have been allowed to come that close. "This is the sign by which we recognize you," the puppet said, "but if you wish you may continue as you are in disguise." 
>
> And your father and his puppet returned to the stage, never turning their backs on the girl, as the protocol regarding walking away from royalty. The girl's teacher cried, but the girl herself just looked as if she was thinking. She continued to think through the second act of the pupet play, but by the third act she was clapping and laughing as loudly as the rest of them. I really don't know why I thought your reaching the end of that story would be a good moment to kiss you; I wasn't entirely surprised that it didn't work" (103-4).

> On New Year's Eve, I went to a party with a tarot reader, a man who examined my cards and told me, his face pinched with sorrow, that my mother would be dead within the year—and then in the damp chill of early spring she had a stroke, and though she would recover in time for the trip, we both agreed she should not travel on her own, so here I was in the Duomo di Arezzo, waiting for my mother to lean over and whisper that she couldn't understand the guide, the girl's accent was too thick and she was speaking too quickly, and why did she have to wear her hair like that anyway. My mother had never understood women who chose against conventional prettiness. Every day I had woken with a leaden sadness because I knew in my heart that this was the last trip my mother would ever take and Italy was all she had wanted (for months a Tuscan field had been the background on her phone) and now that she was here, nothing pleased her. If it wasn't the guide, it was the heat or the uneven streets or no washcloths in the hotel or no ice in the restaurants or the boorish man who had recently lost his wife and had possibly abandoned our group for the company of stateless and impoverished roadside prostitutes. And of course we had set ourselves up for failure, the two of us, for how could any trip, no matter how splendid, bear up under the brutal weight of last? (47)
