        ## Disclaimer

        I'm typing this on a scuffed wireless keyboard which seems to have minor connectivity issues due to the USB
        being a tad out of range. I'm also not using an actual spell-checker. Don't question the setup. All errors in
        spelling, grammar, spacing are of course mine (except when they aren't, of course).

        Additionally, this is quite the lengthy story(?). I tried to keep the most interesting bits in so hopefully it's
        a fun rabbit hole to go down.

        ## Poverty Franchises
        ```
        Q: What is a poverty franchise?
        ```
        ```
        A: It's when a sports franchise (team) regularly performs poorly. Usually over several years or even decades. It
        can also be characterized by dysfunctional management, ownership and a disappointed fan base. It almost always
        has nothing to do with money.
        ```
        —u/finalfourcuse <sup>[3]</sup>


        A nice phrase to have in your sports vocabulary. Of particlar relevance to you is probably... well the NY Jets
        are pretty bad right now (longest NFL Playoff drought, also fun watch maybe
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w649VE3ZCcQ). And the Brooklyn Nets are back to being a poverty franchise
        probably after their superteam completely imploded (a whole other story, I think I told you about it?). The NY
        Knicks haven't been in a great spot recently (hovering around mediocrity, see LOLKnicks <sup>[4]</sup>) though
        they are actually kinda good this season.

        But true poverty franchises that are universally recognized by their sports fans would be the Cleveland Browns
        (obligatory Browns bad moment), the Detroit Lions, the San Diego Padres, the Kings (hey they're good this
        season!!!), and... the sleeper poverty franchise that is the Arizona Cardinals.

        Seriously, the Cardinals have historically been terrible, but unlike those New York teams, no one really
        remembers the Cardinals.

        <img src=".\assets\No One Notices the Cards.png" alt="Unlucky">

        ## Arizona Sports Hell
        ```
        Q: Did you hear that Arizona's football team doesn't have a website?
        ```
        ```
        A: They can't string three "Ws" together.<sup>[2]</sup>
        ```

        I was actually talking about this to an Arizona native before spring break. Of the 4 major sports (NFL, NHL,
        NBA, MLB) Arizona sports teams have a combined 1 championship (go 2001 Diamondbacks after 9/11!—literally that's
        how my mom remembers the one time AZ sports pulled out the chip, as a post-9/11 affair. ) The other
        championships you might see for AZ sports teams came when such teams were not located in AZ, such as the 3
        championships the Winnipeg Jets won before becoming the Arizona Coyotes (who coincidentally also suck and have
        the second lowest franchise win percentage in the NHL).<sup>[7]</sup>


        ```
        "In 2012, the Cardinals became the first NFL franchise to lose 700 games since its inception."<sup>[6]</sup>
        ```

        Here's a little bit of football trivia. The team with the current highest winning percentage in the NFL are the
        Dallas Cowboys with a win rate of roughly 57.4%. (550-408). The team with the current lowest winning percentage
        are the Tampa Bay Buccanneers with an abyssmal lifetime winrate of .404 (299-442). This is followed by the
        Jacksonville Jaguars' .420 (189-261). At the third worst winning percentage are the Cardinals .426
        (581-790).<sup>[5]</sup> You might be thinking, "Oh, third worst, that's bad but technically not the worst!" You
        would be right, but I will point out the Cardinals are one of the oldest franchises in the NFL (their first game
        was in 1920). The Jags and the Bucs have existed for at least 5 decades less (and the Bucs have 2 championship
        wins). That is to say the Cards have been consistently bad for much, much longer than these other two
        franchises.

        In the modern era (since the AFL-NFL merger in 1970) the Cardinals have won 7 playoff games and appeared in 2
        NFC Championship games with a record of 1-1 in such games (shoutout to Kurt Warner, one of the best undrafted
        players ever). Three of their playoff wins came in the team's lone Superbowl appearance season in 2008. They
        have only won their division 5 times since 1970—in football you play in divisions of 4 teams based on geography,
        you play more games versus teams in your division and winning the division locks a spot in the playoffs.

        So historically the Cards have sucked. What about now? Well, I'm sure you can surmise it's more of the same, but
        recently we've had some fun antics that are at least worth laughing at. Is this coping? Well, this entire page
        is coping (better to laugh than to cry etc. etc.)

        Enter our lord and savior, the COD menace himself, Kyler Murray.

        ## Short King
        The Heisman (award meant to be presented to the best player in college football that season) winner in 2018,
        Kyler Murray was mocked as the top pick of the draft. Selecting Murray with the first overall draft pick in 2018
        was definitely a better decision than the Kings selecting Marvin Bagley the Third second overall in 2018. This
        call was actually quite the risky move from the AZ front office: the year prior, they had selected quarterback
        Josh Rosen with the tenth overall draft pick. Rosen looked like a bust (he was a bust). A rare W for AZ
        management.

        Don't get it twisted, Kyler is actually a good football player and QB. One of the prototypical
        "dual-threat"<sup>#</sup> quarterbacks of his generation, Kyler Murray is very elusive (hard for defenses to
        tackle) and has a killer deep ball (he throw ball far). Below I linked an example of a crazy play showcasing his
        abilities.

        [Insane
        Play](https://www.nfl.com/videos/can-t-miss-play-kyler-murray-s-two-point-conversion-run-lasts-for-20-seconds)

        One of the first things you'll notice about Kyler is that he's short. Listed at 5-10, there were certainly
        concerns about his height and size to play in the NFL. Ultimately it did not hurt his draft stock, but it's
        worth noting QBs this short are the exception and not the norm in football. Jokes about Kyler being a toddler
        are partly rooted in his issues in the height department. (more to come on this later)

        \# QBs throw the ball, but they can also run the ball for yards. Dual-threat QBs excel at both (as opposed to
        pocket-passers, who are mostly limited to throwing). Notable dual-threat QBs include Lamar Jackson, Jalen Hurts,
        and Patrick Mahomes.

        ## Had me in the first half, ngl
        Kyler starts off playing well in 2019, breaking numerous Cardinal franchise records for rookie QBs. He won NFL
        offensive rookie of the year and actually took the Cards to the playoffs in 2021, the first time since 2015
        (they lost in the Wildcard, but oh well). He made 2 consecutive Pro Bowls in 2020 and 2021 before getting
        injured in 2022. He's unfortunately expected to miss half of the upcoming 2023 season with a torn ACL and
        meniscus (ouch).

        Up until now, Kyler has been seen as an above average quarterback. Not a world beater, but capable of having
        flashes where he looks like a top 5 QB.

        Nothing exemplifies this more than the Card's start to the 2021 season...

        <img src=".\assets\contenders-or-pretenders.png" alt="lower-your-expectations">

        You read that right! The Cardinals were actually... good? in 2021. Some amazing stuff. I know for sure my dad
        and uncles could not believe it would hold out (FORESHADOW WARNING).

        What's this you say? The Cardinals finished the 2021 season 11-6, barely making it into the playoffs before
        losing to rival and eventual Superbowl Champions the L.A Rams? Wait, no, that would mean mathematically...

        Yeah, the Cardinals had a massive season collapse going 4-6 in the last 10 games of the season.

        Here's a particularly fun way to describe the season. Heading into their Week 15 matchup with the Cards on
        December 19, the Detroit Lions (you might remember as another poverty franchise, shoutout to Jared Goff and the
        Goffense) had a singular win; they started the season with 8 consecutive losses and had a record of 1-1-11 (they
        tied a game versus the Steelers). Can you guess who won?

        Let's just let this reddit thread do the talking.

        <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AZCardinals/comments/rk4hjs/its_that_time_of_year_again/">
          <img src=".\assets\its-that-time-of-year.png" alt="Unlucky">
        </a>

        It wasn't even close either...

        Anyways, for 7 weeks Kyler Murray was an MVP candidate. Then a combination of the injury to star Wide Receiver
        DeAndre Hopkins, a classic coaching choke job by then head coach Kliff Kingsbury, and nagging injuries to Kyler
        led to a late season slide that proved once again, that the Cardinals are just pretenders. Murray's consistency
        is lamented and there's actually a big debate over whether the Cards should sign him to the max contract in the
        next season. They eventually do (5 years for 230 million!!<sup>[9]</sup>), tying the future of the franchise to
        him for the next 5 years. And then a couple months later he gets a season ending injury in Week 14 :/

        ## He's a gamer
        Funny thing about this contract: Kyler has a very strange clause in the contract when it was initially leaked.
        Now known as the "Homework Clause" it stipulates Kyler needs to do a required 4 hours of "independent study" a
        week. While the clause is removed in the final version, it raises bizarre questions about Kyler's work ethic and
        is an overall bad look. This is coupled with... other aspects of Kyler's character don't do him many favors.

        ```
        "Player shall not receive any credit for Independent Study with respect to any time periods during which any
        material is displayed or played on an iPad or electronic device if (a) Player is not personally studying or
        watching the material while it is being displayed or played or (b) Player is engaged in any other activity that
        may distract his attention (for example, watching television, playing video games or browsing the internet)
        while such material is being displayed or played." <sup>[10]</sup>
        ```

        You see Kyler is an avid gamer. He even signed to FaZe clan in 2021 and he streams on Twitch. This HW clause
        really triggered the internet and some people got around to digging.

        https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/weamew/a_statistical_analysis_of_kyler_murrays/

        TLDR for this very much tongue-in-cheek "analysis." Kyler performs worse on the field on weekends where players
        can get double experience for playing. Other self-labelled "analysis" show Kyler's numbers drop slightly after
        the release of the new COD games each year. Kyler's HW clause, love of video games, and umm... shortcomings in
        the height department have led become a meme in the community, prompting this Gridiron Heights Episode from last
        season.

        [Gridiron Heights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUqsc2u-t88)

        ## The Future
        I don't have much faith in the Cards for 2023. They finally got rid of their mid coach (Kliff Kingsbury, who is
        now notorious for buying a one-way ticket to Thailand after his dismissal) but by all indications seem to be
        tanking for the 2023 season. With Kyler having a severe injury they have been offering star receieved DeAndre
        Hopkins in trade packages. It's looking like a 5 win season once again with no real signs of progress.

        So there you go, a brief overview of the Arizona Cardinals, the NFL's sleeper worse franchise. Really, if you
        look up Cardinals in google you get the St. Louis Cardinals more than likely. Become a fan of those Cardinals,
        instead.
